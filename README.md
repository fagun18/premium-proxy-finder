# premium-proxy-finder


Building a script to find premium proxy using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python would involve several steps:

Scraping a website that lists premium proxy servers using Python and a library such as BeautifulSoup or Scrapy.

Storing the proxy server information in a database or JSON file.

Creating an HTML page that allows the user to search for proxy servers based on specific criteria such as location, anonymity level, and protocol.

Using CSS to style the page and make it visually appealing.

Using JavaScript to fetch the proxy server information from the database or JSON file and display it on the HTML page based on the user's search criteria.

Here's an example of how you can use Python and the library BeautifulSoup to scrape a website that lists proxy servers and store the information in a JSON file:

This script uses the requests library to make a GET request to the website that lists proxy servers. It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML, extract the proxy server information, and store it in a JSON file.

Then you can use Javascript to fetch the proxy server information from the JSON file and display it on the HTML page based on the user's search criteria. You can also use jQuery to make the request and parse the JSON file.

It's important to mention that Scraping websites for information can be illegal if not done with the proper authorization, and also using a proxy server for illegal activities is also illegal. It's important to use the script only for legal and ethical reasons.
